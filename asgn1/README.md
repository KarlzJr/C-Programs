This program imitates David Moffat's dice game 'Pass the Pig' (see below for
rules of the game) This program takes 2 user inputs that uses it to 
determine the amount of players and the random seed of the game.

Two User Inputs:
    1. amount of players, if wrong amount presented defults to 2
    2. player chooses a random seed, if invalid, defults to 2021

Rules of the Game:
    players take turns rolling a die and depending on what lands the player
    either earns points or their turn ends. The case in which their turn
    ends is when they roll the pig on its side or they reach 100 points.
